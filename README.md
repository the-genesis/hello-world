# hello-world
Do not think this is the first repo I created on here. It's the third. Better late than never, though.

Hi! My name is Genesis and I'm a Web designer. I would actually prefer to call myself a UI/UX designer, but I don't know... Identity issues, I guess. Anyway, I design stuff that live on the web. Sometimes, if they're not very complicated, I (help) build them, too. I'm working on this though. I'm learning frontend development. That way, I can (almost always) help build awesome stuff I designed.

I am Nigerian, and I live and work in the beautiful city of Ibadan. I'm passionate about design and business and the intersection between the two. I build websites that help businesses (and people) acheive goals.

I like wolves, love drinking garri, and the only sport I could probably partake in is cycling (not that I'm that good at it)!

Nice to meet you, too! :)

PS: I spent waay too much time writing this!

PPS (PSS??): I also design stuff that live offline, too... Just so you know... Apps and such....... Comes with the job, really!
